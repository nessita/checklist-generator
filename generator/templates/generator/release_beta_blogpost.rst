Django {{ final_version }} beta 1 is now available. It represents the second
stage in the {{ final_version }} release cycle and is an opportunity to try out
the changes coming in Django {{ final_version }}.

Django {{ final_version }} {{ instance.feature_release.tagline }}, which you
can read about in `the in-development {{ final_version }} release notes
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/{{ final_version }}/>`_.

Only bugs in new features and regressions from earlier Django versions will be
fixed between now and the {{ final_version }} final release. Translations will
be updated following the "string freeze", which occurs when the release
candidate is issued. The `current release schedule
<https://www.djangoproject.com/download/{{ final_version }}/roadmap/>`_ calls
for a release candidate in about a month, with the final release scheduled
roughly two weeks later on {{ instance.feature_release.when|date:"F j" }}.

Early and frequent testing from the community will help minimize the number of
bugs in the release. Updates on the release schedule are available `on the
Django forum <{{ instance.feature_release.forum_post }}>`_.

As with all alpha and beta packages, this release is **not** for production
use. However, if you'd like to try some of the new features or help find and
fix bugs (which should be reported to `the issue tracker
<https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket>`_), you can grab a copy of the beta
package from `our downloads page <https://www.djangoproject.com/download/>`_ or
on PyPI.
